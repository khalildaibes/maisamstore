## Admin Guide ‚öôÔ∏è

### Managing Products via Sanity.io

   - To manage products, visit your Sanity Studio URL (e.g., `https://your-store.sanity.studio`). Log in with your admin credentials.

2. **Adding/Editing Products**:
   - Inside the "Products" section, you can create new products or edit existing ones. You can update:
     - **Title**: The product name.
     - **Images**: Upload or remove images for the product.
     - **Price**: Adjust pricing.
     - **Stock Availability**: Set whether the product is in stock or out of stock.
     - **Description**: Provide a detailed description of the product.
   
3. **Publishing Products**:
   - After editing or adding a new product, ensure you publish the changes by clicking the "Publish" button. Changes are reflected on the live website almost instantly.

### Updating Website Content

   - Using Sanity, you can also update static content like homepage banners, promotional sections, and other marketing text. These sections can be found under the "Pages" or "Homepage" sections of your Sanity Studio.

### Deploying Changes

1. **Vercel Deployment**:
   - For codebase changes, push your changes to your GitHub repository. Vercel will automatically build and deploy the updated version of your website.
   - In case of manual deployment, log in to your Vercel dashboard, select your project, and trigger a new deployment from there.

## Domain Setup via HeapNames üåê

1. **Domain Purchase**:
   - The custom domain (e.g., `www.yourstore.com`) was purchased via **HeapNames**. After purchasing, domain DNS settings were configured to point to Vercel‚Äôs servers.

2. **Linking Domain to Vercel**:
   - Log in to your **HeapNames** account and navigate to domain settings.
   - Update the **DNS records**:
     - **A Records**: Point the domain to the IP addresses provided by Vercel.
     - **CNAME Record**: Set up `www` to point to your Vercel project URL (e.g., `your-store.vercel.app`).
   - After the DNS settings propagate (usually takes a few minutes), the domain will be live.

---

## Common Issues ‚ö†Ô∏è

1. **Product Not Displaying**:
   - Ensure the product is published in Sanity.io and check if there are any errors in the Vercel deployment logs.

2. **Domain Not Working**:
   - Double-check DNS settings in your HeapNames account and ensure they point to the correct Vercel project.
   - Use a tool like **DNS Checker** to verify DNS propagation.

3. **Slow Loading Pages**:
   - Clear cache or optimize images in Sanity.io to ensure faster loading times.
   - Use Next.js image optimization to improve performance.
